Here is a short list of the very best personal finance blogs on the internet.
All of these websites are constructed entirely of Excellence.  They are so good
I read every post in their archives.  Each author has found a way to retire in
under 10 years with fairly normal human level salaries and has insightful
things to say about getting to financial freedom.


= Mr Money Mustache =

If I was marooned on a deserted island ... with limited bandwidth and could
only read one blog, this is the one I would choose.  I recommend reading this
blog from first post to last.  MMM introduced me to the idea of early
retirement.  Before that I was adrift, completely uninterested and wanted to
spend the rest of my life working.  His persuasive upbeat writing will blow
your mind on the subject of retirement.  And thats pretty hard to do
considering how boring the subject is.


= Lacking Ambition =

My favorite thing about this blog is its thoughtful exploration of the
philosophy of work, money, and time.  Its also the story of how one guy found
financial independence through real estate and frugality.  I recommend reading
it from the beginning.


= Early Retirement Extremist =

ERE was the best and most popular writer in the early retirement community for
quite a while.  He inspired a whole brigade of bloggers retirees.
Unfortunately he no longer blogs but I still found it worth my time to pore
over his old posts.


Any other great blogs that I should know about?
