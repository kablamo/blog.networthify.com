Here is a short list of the very best personal finance blogs on the internet.
All of these websites are constructed entirely of Excellence.  They are so good
I read every post in their archives.  Each author has found a way to retire in
under 10 years with fairly normal human level salaries and has insightful
things to say about getting to financial freedom.


Mr Money Mustache
-----------------

If I was marooned on a deserted island ... with limited bandwidth and could
only read one blog, this is the one I would choose.  I recommend reading this
blog from first post to last.  <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr
Money Mustache</a> introduced me to the idea of early retirement.  Before that
I was adrift, completely uninterested and wanted to spend the rest of my life
working.  His persuasive upbeat writing will blow your mind on the subject of
retirement.  And thats pretty hard to do considering how boring the subject is.

Lacking Ambition
----------------

My favorite thing about <a href="http://lackingambition.com/">Lacking
Ambition</a> is its thoughtful exploration of the philosophy of work, money,
and time.  Its also the story of how one guy found financial independence
through real estate and frugality.  I recommend reading it from the beginning.

Early Retirement Extremist
--------------------------

<a href="earlyretirementextreme.com">ERE</a> was the best and most popular
writer in the early retirement community for a long time.  Unfortunately he no
longer blogs but I definately found it worth my time to pore over his old
posts.
